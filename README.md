## Planning

### Gold silver bronze planning:

- Bronze:
    - An HTML page with a table of 9 cells.
    - Just enough Javascript to show you who the current player is and change the background color of a cell when you click on it.
    - Just enough CSS to make the cells visible.
- Silver:
    - Enough CSS to make it actually look like a game, and enough Javascript for a "reset" button.
- Gold:
    - CSS transitions or animations, showing "X" and "O" instead of colors, and Javascript that tells you when the game is over and who won.
    - When user hovers over the cell, change cell colour
    - When a 3 in a row occurs, grey out other non-winning cells
